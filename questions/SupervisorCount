Imagine you're exploring the intricate organizational structure of Google, represented as a graph. In this structure:

Each node N corresponds to an individual.
If N reports to M (i.e., M is N's boss), then M is the parent of N.
If P reports to N (i.e., N is P's boss), then P is the child of N.
At Google, an individual's "employee score" is defined as the total number of people they supervise, including themselves.

Your task is to design a function that computes the employee score for any individual within this organizational structure.
